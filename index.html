                        <h1>Behind the sunburn</h1>
                        <h2>by Fatima Baduria - March 29, 2022</h2><br>
                        <br><p>The trip would not have meant much—just a four-hour car drive leading to a sunburn. With summer well on its way, it was a scorching hot day. Still, I found myself basking underneath the afternoon sun, burying my toes in warm sand and catching the waves. The waters were serenely rolling upward from the ocean’s surface, calmly advancing toward me. After sweeping by, seafoam lingered to fizzle around me, clinging to my hair as I laid my head back. The sky I found above me was clear and bright.</p>
                        <br><br><p>I cherished every moment, capturing everything in my mind down to the little details. I knew these memories were like hard candies—sweet, lasting, and in especially difficult times, sucking on one is enough to survive the day.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Looking back, weeks before the trip felt like waves, too, but they were far from serene. They were a relentless rush of stress from balancing online class and work. It got like this sometimes. All my tasks pile up and hit me all at once: the lectures to catch up with, the paperwork, the assigned write-ups for publication. It became increasingly difficult to remember why I love what I do. Before, I was filled with energy and excitement as I signed up and took these responsibilities as a student and writer. Great possibilities and achievements flashed in my mind, painting a vivid picture. In visions, I created masterpieces, wrote remarkable works, and amassed literature that contributed to society.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Perhaps it would be easier if everything did not transpire on a screen. Sitting down in a solitary room to face a laptop for the most part of the day drained more than just battery. I found it ironic—walking to school before was not as tiring as sitting around. Maybe it was the fact that I had been surrounded by friends, the vast space for growth, or the comforting feeling of normalcy that sustained me before the public health crisis. Friends, space, and normalcy—if only I were surrounded more by these than a monitor’s light, maybe motivation would be simpler to find and keep.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Instead, each day became increasingly dull and lifeless. I woke up, trudged five steps toward my desk, then retraced my pace at nightfall, only to do it again after sunrise. It became a routine and there is no knowing when I can finally break from it. I was tempted to take some things off my plate and give up. It was as if my mind was telling me to loosen the grip on my responsibilities, maybe let them go for good.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Suddenly, my family planned a trip to the beach. It was just for a day and a half over the weekend, but for someone who has not gone on vacation for almost two years since the pandemic, it was more than enough. Time crept slowly on that beach, allowing me to treasure each passing minute. Still, I felt that I could float around with my eyes closed in those tranquil waters for a longer time knowing that soon, I would be back in my room to stare at a screen.</p>
                        <br><br><p>When the weekend was over, we drove away from the ocean with me feeling downcast. However, when I reached home and came back to my responsibilities, I felt lighter and more spirited. Somehow, while I was pushing aside all my worries over the trip, I gained the energy I needed to take them on.</p>
                        <br><br><p>So, as I rode out all the waves, both the serene and rough ones, I realized that those tough times were never a sign to give up. It was a signal for something much better: rest. For some, it only takes a good night’s sleep, a chat with friends, or a masked walk outside. For others, it would take a longer time, days or weeks before getting back on track. These things could revitalize. What’s more, they could be memories, feelings, and experiences to hold on to when it feels simpler to give up. When going back to work again, it would be easier to go all out, make every effort, and put one’s heart into every task, knowing that the time for rest was bound to come again. It did not matter how it was done or how long it took. The important thing was to get back the capacity to dream and pursue it.</p>
                        <br><br><p>For me, the kind of rest that did the trick was the long drive, the ocean, and yes, even the sunburn. Besides, I would gladly take a sunburn than a burnout any day.</p>

                        <h1>We are women beings</h1>
                        <h2>by Fatima Baduria - December 10, 2022</h2>
                        <br><br><p>GOING BACK to normal after a stretched time indoors should be exciting, but “normal” has always been different for us women. </p>
                        <br><br><p>It does not always mean “okay.” Merriam-Webster would characterize normal as “usual, typical, or routine.” It is expected, something adhering to a pattern. And the pattern is this: when women go out on their own, fear creeps in. A lot of times, the feeling becomes a premonition. </p>
                        <br><br><p>There had been a pause to the transgressions that the streets constantly witnessed, mostly because they became empty. As most were restricted to their homes, it became safer, at least on the streets. </p>
                        <br><br><p>However, as we gradually come closer to the kind of life we knew before the pandemic, the issue resurfaces. </p>
                        <br><br><p>This story goes on repetitively in a seemingly endless plot, still without a denouement.</p>
                        <br><br><p>We feel the eyes first. We have been told many times to never make eye contact with strangers. Even so, our peripheral vision catches what our center of gaze cannot. </p>
                        <br><br><p>We feel next the red blooming on our cheeks, the unease and vexation bubbling together into a complex flush. Flattery would be a nice feeling—almost like a privilege that dread has made impossible because of what usually happens after.</p>
                        <br><br><p>We hear. It is an unwelcome greeting at times. Other times it is names that we are deplorably given, “babe” or “ganda.” Some men are more creative at being discreet by whistling. Regardless of manner, they are all the same. It is street harassment. </p>
                        <br><br><p>The perpetrators are fully capable of defending themselves. They minimize their crime as simple flirting or giving of compliments. Totally harmless. </p>
                        <br><br><p>However, it is unsolicited; no one can take such things as compliments. The unwelcome is always a disturbance. It trespasses, barging into a sacred, personal bubble supposedly consisting of some degree of peace.</p>
                        <br><br><p>It is uncomfortable and terrifying. No feelings are negative, and indeed, these two are normal experiences for everyone. Yet for women, these have grown from feelings to a shared reality that we have to live with daily, and we should not have to. </p>
                        <br><br><p>It is a derogation, even dehumanizing. What it does is take our bodies for objects of pleasure. Our faces, limbs, and skin are taken apart by their gazes to be examined until, to them, we are no longer humans—not their equals. Their minds mistake us for breathing, life-sized dolls and we are treated as such. </p>
                        <br><br><p>So it is fallacious to think that catcalling merely inconveniences women, that it terrifies us only for a bearable span of time before we come out unscathed. </p>
                        <br><br><p>The “normalcy” of street harassment has long been dictating how women must live, that we must have a man on our side or save enough of our allowance for the luxury of a taxi ride. We are supposed to tweak our lives, the victims. It speaks, too, of a message that we have long been told: the world is not for a woman. It is not a place for us to be comfortable nor to simply live in. Yet we refuse to accept this message. </p>
                        <br><br><p>It should not take a pandemic to ensure safety on the streets, to tame the barbarity. What it should take is realization, understanding of the depths that the issue pervades and awareness enough for perpetrators to stop. </p>
                        <br><br><p>There is a long way to go before we even come close to the possibility of harassment-free streets. Still, we women dream with and for the little ones who are already exposed to the same atrocities. </p>
                        <br><br><p>We dream of an afternoon walk in solitude, enjoying the orange sunset glow after a long, tiring day at school or work. A man or two would pass by, but they mind their own business. We reach home, bearing no wounds from the short walk. </p>
                        <br><br><p>We dream of a proper denouement for street harassment.</p>

                        <h1>The Social Dilemma: From Screens to Real Scenes</h1>
                        <h2>by Fatima Baduria - April 6, 2022</h2>
                        <br><br><p>AS the 2022 national election draws near, the social media climate grows increasingly toxic. The polarization of political beliefs intensifies and ideas ranging from the logical to the conspiratorial find their way to the collective consciousness.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Rather perplexing, online attacks can be similar on both sides of the pole: an accusation of idiocy. Those who stand firm with their preferred national leaders are bemused that other people do not choose the same. The Social Dilemma provides an explanation for this phenomenon.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Directed by Jeff Orlowski, the documentary explores the underside of social media. It zeroes in on the inner workings of the technological industry and exposes the repercussions social media has on society. </p>
                        <br><br><p>Experts in the field who formerly worked in huge companies are featured in the film. Among those who gave their testimonies are Tristan Harris, former employee of Google; Tim Kendall, who worked on Facebook and Pinterest; Jeff Seibert, previously from Twitter; and Jaron Lanier, a computer scientist.</p>
                        <br><br><p>They discuss the operations of social media and its effects, both intentional and not. They outline the severe consequences of unregulated social media use, incorporating its mental, social, and political risks in the film. Most of them became regretful for the technological inventions they made. </p>
                        <br><br><p>From an insider perspective, the profit-driven efforts to increase screen time are explained. The technologists claim that the algorithms have arrived at becoming a manipulative tool, letting their users gaze at the screen. It has become so advanced that the content it provides for every single person is calculated and perfectly tailored for them. Harris emphasizes this to be among the causes of political polarization.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Filipinos who are strong-willed and who emphasize their color-marked political belief have seen social media to be a platform where they can effectively impose their beliefs to the public. </p>
                        <br><br><p>Since most people are equipped to use social media, it has been weaponized to destabilize democratic elections by propagating sensational political information. Its veracity does not matter as long as the message capitalizes on the users’ attention. </p>
                        <br><br><p>To further support the film, a fictional narration accompanied by real-life interview records are used. The narrative presents the influence of these widely used applications through the lens of Ben (Skyler Gisondo).</p>
                        <br><br><p>Ben’s immersion in the digital realm goes from social to political. At first, he turns to social media as an emotional pacifier right after a heartbreak. He scrolls his way to distraction until he comes upon political discourse. </p>
                        <br><br><p>As he gains interest in the matter, he looks to social media personalities for related information. He relents to their words as if they were grounded on solid evidence—what is true in his phone becomes true in the world.</p>
                        <br><br><p>These events portray the thinning boundary between the digital and the physical realm. Screens are seen projected on the walls surrounding Ben. </p>
                        <br><br><p>Other elements in the frame accentuate the message. Ben is seen enveloped by darkness but touched by intense hues of red, then violet while melancholic jazz plays in the background.</p>
                        <br><br><p>However, the story takes an improbable turn in its progression. </p>
                        <br><br><p>With his eyes barely leaving the screen, he walks towards a political rally where he soon faces trouble. The sudden struggle that comes upon him, marking the drama’s climax, is too much of a coincidence to be likely. </p>
                        <br><br><p>This improbable sequence of events is a definite hitch, given the realistic grounds of the film. From this, the general integrity of the documentary is placed at risk. It can raise questions of possible exaggeration and even fear-mongering as the professionals claim that the issue with the technological industry is an existential crisis.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Kendall expresses his worry about the possibility of a civil war, while Lanier states that the potential destruction of civilization is at hand if democracy remains at risk. Harris also affirms an existential threat but clarifies that the social media applications most likely neither intended nor foresee it. </p>
                        <br><br><p>Nonetheless, the film is impressively driven by its clear and strong intent, allowing it to present the unfamiliar within the most familiar technology. It is done with artistic grace, evident in the clever structuring of the film and perfectly crafting of the visuals to supplement the discourse.</p>
                        <br><br><p>More importantly, an essential message is driven home. Although technology can become a potent weapon, its users always have the last word on directing its advancement. In the end, a tool is never more powerful than its wielder. </p>

                        <h1>11,103: Bite-sized bitter narratives</h1>
                        <h2>by Fatima Baduria - October 3, 2022</h2>
                        <br><br><p>FORGETFULNESS IS a sickness to which storytelling is the only known cure. But some stories are so heavy that they tie tongues, silencing the narrators. It is the problem of those who were witnesses and victims of the human rights violations under Martial Law. Yet, in the documentary 11,103, they choose again to be heroes, bravely recounting history for those who cannot—but must—remember.</p>
                        <br><br><p>More than 75,000 Filipinos claimed to be victims of the violations under the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. 11,103 is the number of those recognized by the state, compensated by the government under Republic Act No. 10368 or the Human Rights Victims Reparation and Recognition Act of 2013. </p>
                        <br><br><p>In the film directed by Jeannette Ifurung and Miguel Alcazaren, Martial Law survivors, alongside their narratives, are placed in the limelight.</p>
                        <br><br><p>In recent years, other films about Martial Law have been released, such as Benedict Mique’s ML and Vince Tañada’s Katips. Both boldly demonstrate the brutality of torture that some viewers would avert their eyes in discomfort, or avoid viewing them altogether. </p>
                        <br><br><p>11,103 weakens the barrier that uneasiness would serve in communicating the truth, without omitting facts of cruelty. It makes the narratives more ingestible that even younger audiences may watch. The Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) rated it as PG-13.</p>
                        <br><br><p>While the stories are told explicitly, it is visually portrayed through a flat animation of black and white sketches. The combination of the animation style and graphic description bears the authenticity of events that are made easier to grasp. </p>
                        <br><br><p>Cris Palabay is among those who survived to tell their history. He narrates how his family fell victim to violence under Martial Law. Palabay himself was arrested twice without any charges against him. He recounts how he was placed in solitary confinement and tortured in different ways. Oftentimes, it is the fate of the activists then, even those who are students like him. </p>
                        <br><br><p>It is not only activists who were targeted. Mariam, Mohammad, and Madaki Kanda recounts the Malisbong Massacre in Mindanao, which they survived as children. Due to assumptions that there were rebels in the area, naval ships bombed the barangays along the coast of Palimbang, Mariam says. Some residents hid up the mountains, and those who were left were told to gather inside the mosque of Malisbong. Despite promises from the military that they would not be harmed, many were not able to leave the mosque alive.</p>
                        <br><br><p>The close-up shots of the narrators offer the stories in a more personal manner, setting it apart from other films about Martial Law. Other films would tell that, indeed, there have been abuse and torture sponsored by the government and stop there. 11,103 ties these atrocities to faces—living people who experienced it first-hand. It introduces the audience to the people who have seen and experienced a portion of history that they may only have heard about.</p>
                        <br><br><p>The film also shows snippets of the ongoing preparations and making of a state-sponsored museum about Martial Law. Though there are doubts on whether it will be supported by  the current Marcos administration, it voices the hope that the true events would be recognized not only by the people but the government as well.</p>
                        <br><br><p>As the documentary reaches its conclusion, however, the audience may feel a sense of lack in the amount of narratives told. It could have added more stories from the survivors—more evidence of abuse—seeing how it has effectively piqued the attention of its viewers. </p>
                        <br><br><p>11,103, in its authenticity and strategic storytelling, becomes the embodiment of what a forgetful nation needs. It is the bitter pill for remembrance, divided into fragments to ease its consumption. In the end, the documentary evidently does justice to the people it is made for, all 11,103 and more.</p>

                        <h1>Katips: Mga bayaning umibig</h1>
                        <h2>by Fatima Baduria - August 12, 2022</h2>
                        <br><br><p>SA ISANG pelikulang pumapatungkol sa pagkabayani ng mga kabataan, may isang temang hindi inaasahang tumaginting: romansa. Karaniwang mabigat ang mga kwentong ganitong uri: puno ng paghihirap, sakripisyo, at pagkasawi bago ang pagtatagumpay. Bagamat bahagi nito ang kabigatan, umangat sa pelikula ang ideya ng pag-ibig na may iba’t ibang mukha. May pag-ibig para sa sarili, kaibigan, kasintahan, pamilya, at kung mayroon pang puwang, para sa bayan.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Ito ang kaisipang bumibida sa Katips na isinulat at idinerehe ni Vince Tañada at nakasentro sa mga estudyanteng aktibista. Sino pa ba ang mga pinakatigib sa damdamin—sabik at handa pagdating sa pag-ibig—kundi ang kabataan? Madaling nagningas sa kanila ang naising mailaban ang prinsipyo, para sa pagmamahal sa bayan, kahit malagim ang kasunod nito.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Sa lupon ng mga batang aktibistang kabilang sa National Union of Students of the Philippines, si Greg (Jerome Ponce) ang kinikilalang pinuno. Ilan sa mga kasamahan niya roon ay si Panyong (Vince Tañada) na manunulat ng Ang Bayan, at si Alet (Adelle Ibarrientos) na nangangalaga sa Katips house, bahay na tinutuluyan ng mga aktibista. Dito tumutuloy ang tatlo, at dumagdag sa kanila si Lara (Nicole Asensio), anak ng yumaong propesor ng University of the Philippines. Dahil sa pagkamatay ng ama niya sa kamay ng Metropolitan Command (MetroCom), nahimok siyang sundan ang mga yapak nito at makiisa sa hanay nina Greg.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Ginanap ang mga pakikibaka, mga mapayapang rally na kasama pa ang mga pari at madre. Subalit walang mapayapa sa sagot ng mga pulis na pinamumunuan ni Lieutenant Sales (Mon Confiado). Dahil sa kasakiman ng MetroCom, mapipilitan ang mga kabataang harapin ang mga kalagimang masyadong mabigat at malupit.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Subalit hindi naging hadlang ang kaguluhan sa ikot ng kani-kanilang buhay. Katunayan, dito pa nakatagpo ng pag-ibig ang ilan sa kanila—si Greg at Lara; Panyong at Alet; Estong (Joshua Bulot) at Susie (Vean Olmedo); Art (Johnrey Rivas) at Lally (Carla Lim). Ipinakita ng pelikula ang unti-unting pag-usbong ng romansa sa pagitan ng mga tauhan gamit ang kahanga-hangang paghahabi ng mga dayalogo.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Kapansin-pansin ito sa mga usapan ng apat na pares. Bagamat magkakahiwalay ang mga pag-uusap, pinag-ugnay ang mga ito, ginamitan ng magkakaparehong mga salita para pagtagpiin ang mga linya ng magkakaibang usapan. Mula sa mainit na palitan nina Greg at Lara, mapupunta ang eksena sa mga torpeng sina Panyong at Alet, patungo sa matatamis na salita nina Art at Lally, hanggang sa nakaaaliw na biruan nina Estong at Susie.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Higit na nadadala ang mga manonood gawa ng mga kantang isinaliw sa mga pangyayari. Agaw-pansin ang pagkakalapat ng tono sa mga liriko. Kumakapit sa isip ng mga manonood ang tono ng “katips, katips,” o ng “First Quarter Storm, Battle of Mendiola,” maging ng iba pang mga kanta.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Kahanga-hanga rin ang pagganap ng mga aktor sa kani-kanilang karakter, lalo na si Adelle Ibarrientos bilang Alet. Makikitang tiyak sa pagkatao ni Alet ang pag-akto niya sa kabila ng iba’t ibang pinagdaanan ng karakter. Mula sa magagaan hanggang pinakamabibigat na mga eksena, kalkuladong mga galaw at pagbitbit niya ng emosyon ang nakapagdadala sa mga manonood.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Napakinabangan namang mabuti ang mga katangian ng tagpuan para maipahayag ang dynamics ng mga tauhan. Sa isang eksena, makikitang nasa taas ng hagdan sina Panyong, Alet, at Greg habang nasa ibaba si Lara noong hindi pa siya aktibista.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Madalas na ginamit ang tilt angle sa pelikula, dagdag sa pagpapakita ng pangkalahatang kalooban ng mga karakter habang nasa gitna ng pakikipaglaban.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Subalit, may ilang mga birong pumapalya habang hinahaluan ng komedya ang pelikula, lalo na pagkatapos ng mga emosyonal na pangyayari. Isa na rito ang linya ni Susie nang mapagkamalan niyang apelyido ang “corpus” sa writ of habeas corpus, noong katatapos lang mahuli ang ilan sa kanilang mga kasamahan.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Hindi naging malinaw ang intensyon sa ilang mga sinematikong desisyon. Halimbawa, kapansin-pansing pinagaan ang eksena ng First Quarter Storm. Hindi binigyang diin kung gaano kalubha ang pangyayari dahil mas nakatuon pa ito sa pagpapaganda ng choreography ng kasabay na kanta. Pero sa kalagitnaan ng pelikula, kabilang ang mga eksenang torture, tahasan naman itong ipinakita.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Gayunpaman, matagumpay ang pelikula sa pagkwento ng mga pangyayari mula sa ibaba, ang pagbigay ng mukha sa mga aktibistang inabuso at pinahirapan. Hindi lang pagkabayani nila ang ipinakilala, pati na rin ang kanilang pagkatao. Inilahad dito ang mga bayani sa kanilang murang edad na sa gitna ng pang-aabuso ay piniling umibig sa bayan at lumaban. Sa gitna ng pakikibaka, nakaranas sila ng takot, duda, at trahedya, pero sa kabila nito, nakatagpo rin sila ng tapang, pagkakaibigan, at ang pinakamahalaga, pagmamahal na makapagdadala ng tagumpay.</p>
                        <br><br><p>May tawag sa mga manonood ang Katips: buong tapang na paalabin ang damdamin ng pagmamahal para sa bayan. Maraming taon man ang lumipas na mula noong maganap ang kalupitan sa ilalim ng diktadurya ni Ferdinand Marcos Sr., walang dapat maging manhid at walang dapat makalimot.</p>

                        <br><br><p>You marveled at the Arch the first time you saw it. </p>
                        <br><br><p>It was a rather long walk from España to St. Raymund’s, but you loved the stroll beneath the trees. The day before, the thought of doing that had been surreal. The pulse in your chest became as quick as your pace; before you knew it, you were outside your classroom. As you pushed the door open, you could not help but smile. You saw faces you have only seen in pictures.</p>
                        <br><br><p>You liked the campus grounds even more when they were lit in various colors at night. </p>
                        <br><br><p>It was a surprisingly warm night in December, perhaps because of the crowd. You have never seen the field so full of people. You never liked crowds, but your friends were close, and there was music. Everyone was singing and laughing, and so were you. Though it was dark, lights hung from posts and trees. What truly illuminated the night, however, was the burst of sparks in the sky. </p>
                        <br><br><p>You replayed the memories as you walked around for the last time, wearing a toga. </p>
                        <br><br><p>It was a long day, but you wished it was longer. As students spilled out from the Quadricentennial Pavilion, you made your way to your friends. You embraced them as tight as you could.</p>
                        <br><br><p>When it was time, you walked towards the gate. Before leaving, you glanced back at the scene one last time. You smiled, then marched away. </p>

                        <h1>A Game of Trolls: The Foul Job Exposed</h1>
                        <h2>by Fatima Baduria - April 19, 2022</h2>
                        <br><br><p>TROLLING AS a profession perpetuates online with social media as its main operational base. Many misleading messages are crafted to tip the scale towards a presidential bet. As long as this purpose is served, accuracy ceases to matter. As the trolls oppose the truth, their only logical strategy is to suppress logic. </p>
                        <br><br><p>Directed by Maribel Legarda and written by Liza Magtoto, A Game of Trolls conveys a palpable reality through a musical play. The play focuses on a particular historical epoch in the Philippines: the 1970s Martial Law under the dictatorship of former president Ferdinand Marcos. This chapter in history arises as a key project for the trolls in the play since revising it can hasten their political schemes. </p>
                        <br><br><p>Taking center stage as the main protagonist is a troll himself, Hector (Myke Salomon). Striving to reach competitive standards, he does the job without failing: creating troll accounts, adopting fallacious arguments, and sensationalizing deceitful scripts. </p>
                        <br><br><p>Despite being assiduous in his work, Hector is not fully convinced of the pro-Marcos ideals. He shows a tinge of hesitation as he begins to question the motives of their leader, Bimbam (Vince Lim). </p>
                        <br><br><p>Complicating Hector’s state of affairs is the long-standing strain in his relationship with his mother, Tere (Upeng Galang-Fernandez), an activist during Martial Law. Becoming a full-time activist and a mother was difficult for Tere to balance, which eventually caused Hector to resent his mother and her ideals in his adult years.</p>
                        <br><br><p>Using his troll account, Hector unknowingly clashes with his close friend Cons (Gold Villar Lim) on social media. In the heated argument, Cons presents to him the martial law victims. Stubbornly, Hector finishes the exchange by deeming them irrelevant.  </p>
                        <br><br><p>Little does he know that this would offend the dead whose stories are being erased. The martial law victims then arise to visit him in a manner reminiscent of Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol. </p>
                        <br><br><p>The victims who visit Hector provide a glance at their grim experiences during the Martial Law. As he undergoes the violence and other adversities of torture firsthand, the audience is taken on a harrowing experience in the play. But at the same time, the satirical style of the play saves it from being too heavy. </p>
                        <br><br><p>In one scene, Hector is made to stand in the shoes of a doctor who was marked as subersibo (subversive). The doctor, now a ghost, makes him see the unjust fate he suffered. In another scene, two other victims propel him to experience the various types of torture through a comical performance that can be likened to a variety show. </p>
                        <br><br><p>Interestingly, the play combines several art disciplines: music, poetry, dance, and rap. In effect, the audience’s artistic appetite is gratified. </p>
                        <br><br><p>Despite its artistic endeavor, the visuals of the set are lacking with its minimalistic production design. Its usage of only abstract and geometrical shapes to suggest a specific setting and object is often misleading or confusing to the viewers’ eyes. </p>
                        <br><br><p>On a good note, however, the abstract set design can shift the audience’s focus to the grander ocular elements. Lighting techniques fittingly illuminate the stage. The spotlight amply directs the viewer’s attention while highlighting essential parts of the stage. Various light intensities and colors also steer the mood, utilizing yellow to suggest humor and red to emphasize distress. </p>
                        <br><br><p>Furthermore, the actors have visibly mastered their craft, rendering a smooth performance. Throughout the play, the cast remained sincere to their characters through apt facial expressions, body movements, and deliverance of dialogue. </p>
                        <br><br><p>The result: a powerful staging capable of moving its audience in both its tragic and comedic aspects. </p>
                        <br><br><p>Ultimately, completing the artistry is its remarkable musicality. The sequence of songs and arrangements by Vincent de Jesus vitalizes the show, bringing color to the story and the characters. One iconic musical segment is the trolls’ introductory song. Its lyrics present their line of work with wit, illustrative of their trolling strategies and motives.</p>
                        <br><br><p>All things considered, A Game of Trolls succeeds in its aim to inform and protest. It becomes an instrument that sheds light on the 1970’s martial law, wrongfully revered as the “golden days” of Philippine history. The enjoyable viewing experience counts only as a bonus because its strongest point is the production’s milieu in providing a fresh and factual perspective. The aftermath is a protest play to remember.</p>
